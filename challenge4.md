#Challenge: Mod 26

#Objective
Decipher flag using ROT13

#Solution Steps
1. Put encrypted text into a rot13 deciphering algorithm
    cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_Ncualgvd}
2. Extracted flag from deciphering 
    flag: picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_Aphnytiq}

#Learned
There are lots of tools available online and ROT13 means to rotate each letter 13 positions forward
